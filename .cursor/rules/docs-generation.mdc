# Documentation Generation Rules

When generating documentation for concepts, CLI commands, tools, or any technical content, follow the **5W1H method** (What, Where, When, Why, How) in a structured, step-by-step format.

## Required Structure

### 1. What?
**Always required.** Provide a clear, concise definition or description of the concept, command, or tool.
- Start with a brief one-sentence summary
- Follow with detailed explanation if needed
- Use simple, clear language

### 2. Where?
**Optional but recommended.** Specify the context, location, or environment where this applies.
- File paths, directories, or system locations
- Platform-specific information (OS, cloud provider, etc.)
- Configuration files or settings locations

### 3. When?
**Optional but recommended.** Explain when to use this concept or command.
- Use cases and scenarios
- Prerequisites or conditions
- Timing considerations

### 4. Why?
**Optional but recommended.** Explain the purpose, benefits, or rationale.
- Problem it solves
- Benefits and advantages
- When to choose this over alternatives

### 5. How?
**Always required.** Provide practical implementation details.
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples or command syntax
- Configuration examples
- Best practices and tips

### Optional: Pros and Cons
**Optional but recommended.** Summarize strengths and trade-offs to help decision-making.
- List **Pros** as bullet points that highlight benefits, advantages, or good use cases
- List **Cons** as bullet points that highlight limitations, risks, or bad use cases
- Keep each point short and concrete (1–2 lines)
- Use this section especially when comparing tools, approaches, or configuration options

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Add examples for complex concepts
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include diagrams or visual aids when helpful
- Mark optional sections clearly
